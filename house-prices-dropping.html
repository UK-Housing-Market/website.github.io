    <h1>UK Housing Market - Will House Prices Drop in 2022?</h1>

    <div class="title-underline"></div>

    <p>Low inventory, heated competition, and massive price gains have made it tough for new buyers in the UK since 2020.</p>

    <p>With rising mortgage rates, it will become even harder for people to get on the property ladder unless house prices drop. Coupled with this are increasing rent prices all over the country, eating away at disposable income that could be used for a deposit.</p>

    <p>Now even modest homes cost as much as lavish ones did a few years ago - many first-time buyers (including myself) are wondering how we are ever going to afford a property unless prices dramatically decrease.</p>

    <p>In this article, I explore the current state of the market and why I think prices will drop over the next few months.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Why are UK house prices so high?</h2>

    <p>There are many factors that cause&nbsp;<a href="https://thehouseprices.co.uk/why-prices-increase-fall">house prices to increase</a> over time. However, the current affordability of houses for first-time buyers is near an all-time low.</p>

    <p>Driven by factors including very low interest rates set by the Bank of England (to try and rebound the economy after the 2008 crash), the ratio of house prices to average salary is higher than it&rsquo;s been over the last 10 years.</p>

    <p>The average price of a UK home has nearly trebled since the turn of the century and has increased by over 60% over the last ten years according to Nationwide data.</p>



    <h3>Prices over the pandemic</h3>

    <p>Growth in average house prices in the UK gathered pace in the second half of 2020, a trend that continued throughout the following two years.</p>

    <p>It had been expected that the end of the stamp duty holiday and furlough in October 2021 would result in a drop in demand for house purchases but that has not been the case. House prices reached record highs in 2022.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-1.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <p>Nationwide says the price of an average home is now &pound;271,613. This is more than a fifth higher than at the start of the pandemic, or around &pound;30,000 higher than June 2021.</p>

    <p>However, data from mortgage lender Halifax paints a slightly different picture. It says the average house price was &pound;294,845 in June, a huge 13% higher than a year ago.</p>



    <hr />


    <h2>Why the housing market is slowing down</h2>

    <h3>Interest rates rising</h3>
    <p>Interest rates have been low for more than a decade. However, since 2021, the Bank of England (BoE) has increased the base rate 5 times, from its record low of 0.1% to 1.25%.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-2.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <p>The BoE is increasing the rates to try and deal with rising inflation. The theory is that increasing interest rates reduces the money people have to spend, therefore decreasing demand for goods and decreasing inflation.</p>

    <p>Increased interest rates cause mortgage rates to increase, meaning that people need to pay more each month for their mortgages.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-5.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <p>For example, if I wanted to buy a house 1 year ago, I could get a mortgage on a property for &pound;1000 / month. With the increased mortgage rate, I may need to pay &pound;1300 / month for the same property.</p>

    <p>Apply this to thousands of first-time buyers and it becomes clear that many people cannot afford the same house as they could last year. This in theory should slow down and even reduce house prices.</p>

    <p>In addition, interest rates are projected to continue to rise, as inflation is out of control.</p>


    <h3>Cost of living crisis</h3>
    <p>Rapidly rising inflation, supply chain issues, and the war in Ukraine have caused a serious cost of living crisis as the price of many essentials have skyrocketed, including energy and food.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This will contribute to the slowdown of the housing market. As household budgets come under pressure, fewer people can afford to stretch themselves to buy homes. In addition, any deposit people were saving to buy a house is now being used to buy essentials.</p>


    <hr />

    <h2>Data showing signs of a slowdown</h2>

    <p>Data from Nationwide building society has shown an annual increase of 11.2% in May 2022 dropping to 10.7% in June, indicating a slowdown.</p>

    <p>Annual house price gains across the UK have slowed for a third month as the weakening economy, cost of living squeeze and rising interest rates started to have an impact on the property market.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-3.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>
    <p><i>Graph showing the 12 month percentage change. You can see that it has stopped increasing over the last few months.</i></p>
    <br />
    <p>Prices rose 10.7% in the year to June, slowing from May&rsquo;s annual rate of 11.2%, its monthly house price index showed. Property values were up 0.3% in June from the previous month, a notable slowdown from May&rsquo;s 0.9% gain.</p>

    <p>Robert Gardner, Nationwide&rsquo;s chief economist, said average prices had increased by more than &pound;26,000 in the past year.</p>

    <p>Gardner said that, at the same time, the stock of homes on the market had remained low, keeping upward pressure on house prices.</p>

    <p>London remained the weakest-performing area, with annual price growth slowing to 6%, from 7.4% in the previous quarter.</p>

    <p>Property website Rightmove has projected house price growth to drop from its current level of 9.7% to 5% by the end of 2022. This follows a monthly increase in house prices of just 0.4% in June, the smallest monthly rise since January.</p>

    <h2>End-of-year house price predictions</h2>
    <p>Given the continued race for space, many housing market predictions remain bullish:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Hamptons house price forecast predicts a rise of 3.5% each year between 2022 and 2024
        </li>
        <li>
            Lloyds Banking Group expect house prices to maintain their current strong levels over the next year, but growth to be much flatter through 2022 at around 1%
        </li>
        <li>
            The Bank of England has predicted house price growth to slow down later this year, with mortgage providers expected to cut down on lending as the economy struggles
        </li>
        <li>
            Property consultancy Cluttons suggests that in some parts of London, prices could fall by as much as 10% next year while Foxtons predict growth of 1-3% in the capital
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the short term, the property market is expected to continue its upward trend. However, high inflation will push interest rates up which will slow the housing market down by the end of the year and into 2023.</p>

    <p>Analysis from Capital Economics predicts that:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The Bank of England base rate will peak at about 3% in the second half of 2023
        </li>
        <li>
            This could in turn push average mortgage rates to 3.6% (while still historically low, that is more than double the 1.6% rate recorded at the end of 2021)
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on this data, Capital Economics has forecast house prices to rise throughout 2022, before falling by 5% in 2023.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Will house prices crash in 2022?</h2>

    <p>As much as I would like it to, I think a crash is unlikely for several reasons (what I mean by a crash is more than a 20% drop in price).</p>

    <h3>Labour market is still strong</h3>
    <p>Employment is currently very high in the UK. However, this could change if high inflation sticks around.</p>

    <p>Continued high inflation may limit the disposable income people have, which in turn will reduce company profits as people are buying less. Companies may then look to fire people in order to remain profitable in uncertain times.</p>

    <p>If the unemployment rate were to increase, fewer people have money to buy houses, reducing the demand side and probably reducing the average cost of a house.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-4.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-price-6.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <h3>Plenty of demand</h3>
    <p>Currently, there is still plenty of demand and a short supply of houses, which continues to drive up prices.</p>

    <p>However, there are a few factors that could put a dampener on the recent spectacular growth, namely the cost of living crisis. Record petrol and energy prices, rising inflation, and tax rises mean most households have less disposable income to spend on buying houses.</p>

    <p>If demand slows down and people have house smaller deposits then the rate of house price growth could fall.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Not everyone thinks prices will slow down soon</h2>

    <p>The EY Item Club - an economic forecasting group - took a more optimistic view of the housing market&rsquo;s likely fortunes. It predicted house prices would enjoy continued growth, and estimated the typical home would end this year worth &pound;52,000 more than it was just before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

    <p>It is predicting prices will end this year 8% higher than they were at the end of 2021, and will then rise by smaller amounts: 1.8% and 1.2% in 2023 and 2024 respectively.</p>

    <p>The group, which bases its figures on the Treasury&rsquo;s model of the UK economy, said that while the rate of house price growth was likely to slow as a result of stretched affordability, rising interest rates, and falling household incomes, other factors such as shortages of homes for sale, low unemployment and the &ldquo;unequal effects&rdquo; of cost of living pressures would stop prices from falling.</p>

    <p>The EY Item Club is predicting that an average UK home will cost &pound;283,000 by the end of this year. That would be 23% higher than the figure of &pound;231,000 during the first three months of 2020, just before the start of the pandemic.</p>

    <h2>UK estate agents report a drop in inquiries</h2>

    <p>UK estate agents reported a sudden drop-off in inquiries for new homes last month, according to a closely watched survey that indicated the heat could be coming out of the housing market after a frenzied two years.</p>

    <p>The monthly UK residential survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found the net balance of buyer inquiries was -7% in May compared with +8% the previous month.</p>

    <p>The figure, which shows that more agents reported a decline in buyer inquiries than reported an increase, adds to evidence that the housing market is beginning to cool, as the cost of living crisis and rising interest rates limit buying power.</p>

    <p>Annual house price growth has remained in double digits during the past two years as the government&rsquo;s stamp duty holiday, low borrowing costs, and a drive for more space shielded the property market from an economic hit from the pandemic.</p>

    <p>But with inflation running at 9% and mortgage rates increasing, many estate agents said the boom would soon come to an end.</p>

    <h2>Should you buy a home now or wait?</h2>
    <p>Buying a house in any market is a highly personal decision. Because homes represent the largest single purchase most people will make in their lifetime, it&rsquo;s crucial to be in a solid financial position before diving in.</p>

    <p>Use a mortgage calculator to find out how much your monthly housing costs will be based on your deposit and interest rate.</p>

    <p>Trying to time the market or predict what might happen next year is not the best homebuying strategy. Instead, it&rsquo;s better to buy based on your budget and needs. If you find a home you love in an area you love and it also fits your budget, then chances are it might be right for you.&nbsp;</p>
