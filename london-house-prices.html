    <h1>London House Prices in 2022 - Price Predictions</h1>



    <p>The rise in London property prices has accelerated, driven by a shortage of supply and increased demand as people return to offices and the social attractions of the capital.</p>

    <p>The Covid pandemic has led to a housing boom across the country, but in London demand has been relatively muted due to reduced migration as home buyers looked for more space outside the city.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>London is the worst-performing market in the UK</h2>
    <p>London is the worst-performing property market, with values up 3.9% in the year through May, Zoopla said in a report on Friday. That&rsquo;s less than half the UK average. It also takes longer in the capital to sell a home than in other regions, according to the property portal.</p>

    <p>The average asking price of a home in London is &pound;682,000, a very slight drop on last month as the property market frenzy of the past two years starts to ease.</p>

    <h3>Reasons for the London growth slowdown</h3>
    <p>The cost of living crisis, rising inflation, more homes being put up for sale, and a traditional summer lull are behind the 1.1% price drop in the capital, according to Rightmove.</p>

    <p>The fifth consecutive base rate rise by the Bank of England last week, as well as looming storm clouds over the economy and the prospect the UK could tip into recession this year, are also denting buyer confidence.</p>

    <p>In summary, the slowdown has been caused by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Increase in interest rates</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cost of living crisis</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Soaring inflation</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Summer lull</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Worries about a recession</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, the property portal found buyer demand is more than double the pre-pandemic five-year average for May, and London asking prices are still 4.9% higher than this time last year.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The exceptional pace of the market is easing a little, as demand gradually normalises and price rises begin to slow, which is very much to be expected given the many record-breaking numbers over the past two year,&rdquo; said Rightmove&rsquo;s Tim Bannister.</p>

    <p>However the market still remains strong for now - a report from On The Market, which showed 84% of London home sellers were confident they would sell in the next three months, and 77% of buyers expected to purchase a property in the same time frame.</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-london-2.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

    <p>&ldquo;A remarkable level of buyer and seller confidence in the housing market prevailed in May, despite considerable headwinds including soaring inflation and another interest rate hike by the Bank of England,&rdquo; said Jason Tebb, CEO of On the Market.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Against this backdrop, evidence is emerging of a rise in the number of new instructions, suggesting the start of an inevitable rebalancing of supply and demand in the market.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Houses rising, apartments falling</h2>

    <p>London&rsquo;s property market is beginning to divide with house prices continuing to rise and apartments declining in value.</p>

    <p>Apartments are down more than 11% from their peak in August 2020, with the median sale now less than &pound;400,000.</p>

    <p>The figures, which are smoothed to remove outlier transactions, show the median price paid for a house reached a new high of almost &pound;634,000.</p>

    <h3>Apartments and houses are diverging</h3>
    <p>Median price (trend) for all London boroughs</p>

    <p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img-london-3.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-london-property-prices-apartment-values-fall/">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-london-property-prices-apartment-values-fall/</a></p>

    <p>The mixed picture suggests that the steam is starting to come out of the capital&rsquo;s property market. A number of boroughs are seeing price declines compared with a year earlier, as higher mortgage rates and a surge in the cost of living limit the amount buyers can pay for homes.</p>

    <p>Prices fell in areas where apartments are prevalent, including Lambeth, Tower Hamlets, and Greenwich. Buyers may not be as willing to pay as much for such homes, especially those with limited or no outside living space, something that&rsquo;s become much more desirable since the pandemic.</p>

    <p>The data does suggest some positive news for property developers. The premium for new homes in the capital has soared, with the median in March almost &pound;680,000 compared with &pound;517,000 for existing homes.</p>
