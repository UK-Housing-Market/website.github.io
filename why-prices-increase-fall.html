	<h1>UK Housing Market - Why Prices Increase and Fall over Time</h1>


	<p>I recently became interested in the housing market after seeing the dramatic increase in house prices over the pandemic period.</p>

	<p>It quickly became apparent that buying a first home was moving out of reach (already is?) for millions of people in the UK.</p>

	<p>Take my situation - I&rsquo;m currently living with my parents in London at the age of 31, with a decent salary in technology, but with little hope of buying a house or flat where I&rsquo;d want to live on my own.</p>

	<p>The whole situation depressed me so I decided to dig into what is actually causing prices to increase, seemingly forever, without any letup.</p>

	<p>This article collates data and information from around the web, using mostly UK government data sources as references.</p>

	<p>I wanted to address the following questions I had:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Is foreign investment in property really driving up prices?
		</li>
		<li>
			Is it harder to buy a house now (for a first-time buyer) than 30 years ago?
		</li>
		<li>
			Are Airbnb properties driving up prices by taking houses off the market?
		</li>
		<li>
			How much does a lack of new housing supply affect prices?
		</li>
		<li>
			Are buy-to-let properties driving up prices?
		</li>
		<li>
			Will housing prices drop to a more affordable level?
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to read the whole article, here&rsquo;s a summary of what I think is the main cause of dramatic house price increases over the last 2010 years:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Low interest rates and a higher mortgage loan to salary ratio</b></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Low interest rates cause low mortgage rates, meaning people can borrow more money to buy a house. People can also now take out a mortgage at up to 5.5x their salary (this was around 3.5 twenty years ago).</p>

	<p>These two points mean that more people can leverage their salary to buy a more expensive house, causing the prices of houses in general to increase.</p>

	<hr />
	<h2>Are house prices increasing?</h2>
	<p>Yes.</p>

	<p>The average house price was a little over &pound;10,000 back in 1977. Roll forward 40 years and the average price has risen to &pound;200,000. Even with the general increase in salaries, the price of goods and services, house prices are now around three times as expensive as they were in the late 1970s.</p>

	<h3>House prices do sometimes drop temporarily</h3>
	<p>There have been times when house prices have increased a lot just because people think prices will continue to rise. This is called a housing market bubble. Bubbles are always followed by housing market crashes when house prices fall sharply.</p>

	<p>This happened in the 1980s. Between 1984 and 1989 house prices doubled, which was much higher than the growth in people&rsquo;s earnings. The unsustainable rise was followed by over five years of falling house prices. It then took until 1999 before house prices had recovered to the level they were in 1989.</p>

	<h2>The current housing situation</h2>

	<h3>A declining number of first-time buyers</h3>
	<p>The graph below shows how the number of first time buyers in the UK is declining.</p>

	<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img3.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

	<p>Rising house prices and the 2008 economic crash could partially explain the decline in the number of first time buyers taking out a mortgage. Between 1980 and 2002, the number of mortgages agreed for first time buyers was averaging around 486,000 per year. However, in 2003 there was a 31% decline in the number of mortgages for first time buyers from 2002.</p>

	<p>2008 saw a further 47% decrease from 2007 as the effects of the economic downturn impacted on the housing market. While some recovery in the numbers of first time buyers has been apparent in 2013/2014, the level remains below the average seen prior to 2003.</p>


	<p>&ldquo;Those aged 22 to 29 years have become less likely to own a home, with the proportion of homeowners having fallen by 10 percentage points between 2008 and 2017 &ndash; from 37% to 27%1.&rdquo;</p>

	<h3>House values vs. average salary</h3>
	<p>The price rises are striking. In the 1930s a typical three-bed house was just 1.5x the average annual salary. By 1997 the average house price was 3.6x the average salary. But in just twenty years that has more than doubled to nearly 8x, and in London, an &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; home is 13x first-time buyers&rsquo; salaries.</p>



	<h3>Mortgage rates have decreased</h3>
	<p>At face value, it seems like it is much harder to buy a house currently with the high house prices. However, the variable mortgage rate has been much higher in the past (up to 15% in 1990, now we are around 2.5%), so people had to pay much more each month for their mortgage back then, meaning they couldn&rsquo;t afford as big a mortgage as they could in the current market.</p>




	<hr />

	<h2>Pros and cons of rising prices</h2>
	<p>Here are some positives and negatives of house prices increasing.</p>
	<h3>Pros:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			People make more money if they sell the house and move to a cheaper area / downsize
		</li>
		<li>
			Inflation makes the loan cheaper as the GBP loses value over time
		</li>
		<li>
			You can refinance or take out a Home Equity Line of Credit as well. You can also take other types of loans using it as collateral
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			High property tax, which can be the biggest downside if you&apos;re not planning to sell
		</li>
		<li>
			Higher insurance cost
		</li>
		<li>
			*People not already on the property ladder will struggle more to buy a house
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Causes of house price increases and decreases</h2>
	<p>After researching for many hours, these are the key factors in house price increases. I&rsquo;ve added an impact rating out of 5 for each one.</p>

	<h2>1. Low interest rates</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 5/5</b></p>

	<p>Low interest rates since the financial crash in 2008 have made borrowing cheap. This means that people can get larger mortgages (as their monthly payments will be lower) and therefore afford more expensive houses.</p>

	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>A house that costs $350k with a 5% mortgage has the same payment as a $450k home with a 3% mortgage.</p>

	<p>The decline in mortgage rates since the early 1990s has been a key driver of house price growth by enabling buyers to borrow ever larger multiples of income.</p>

	<p>So buyers can increase their budget, and this is the case at every price point. Which creates more demand at each price point.</p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HVMRUKQ">Household Variable Mortgage Rate in the United Kingdom</a></p>


	<p>I think a big mistake was keeping interest rates low since 2008, and not increasing them at all. Low interest rates in theory help the economy, as new businesses can borrow more money.</p>

	<p>For example, a car manufacturer can borrow more to build a new factory, or a small business can get a larger loan to set up distribution.</p>

	<p>However, when the economy started to improve after 2008, interest rates should have risen so that the BoE has a tool to use against a weakening economy, such as over the pandemic.</p>


	<p>The BoE&rsquo;s researchers even confirm that high house prices are heavily influenced by, in particular, the central bank&rsquo;s own monetary policy (i.e. historically low interest rates) which drives up house prices.</p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://positivemoney.org/2019/09/bank-of-england-confirms-positive-money-analysis-of-house-prices/">Bank of England finally admits high house prices are determined by finance, not supply and demand.</a></p>



	<h3>Bank of England and the government</h3>
	<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that the Bank of England (BoE) controls interest rates, not the ruling party in government. Therefore comments I see online such as &ldquo;The government won&rsquo;t raise interest rates as it will piss off the majority of the voting population who have houses&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t true, the BoE acts (in theory) independently from the government, so that they can stay out of politics.</p>




	<hr />

	<h2>2. Supply and demand</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 3/5</b></p>
	<p>The price of housing, like the price of any good or service in a free market, is driven partially by the law of supply and demand. When demand increases or supply decreases, prices go up.</p>

	<p>In the absence of some natural disaster, which can decrease the immediate supply of homes, prices rise when demand tends to outpace supply trends.</p>

	<p>The supply of housing can also be slow to react to increases in demand because it takes a long time to build or fix up a house, and in highly developed areas there simply isn&apos;t any more land to build on. So, if there is a sudden or prolonged increase in demand, prices are sure to rise.</p>

	<p>Several things impact supply and demand, including population growth and the number of houses built each year.</p>


	<h3>Population growth</h3>

	<p>The population of the UK has increased over time, meaning that the number of people entering the housing market has also increased.</p>

	<p>Population growth is due to elevated rates of natural increase and net migration. To compound the issue, there has been a lack of growth in average household size, due to a rise in single-person households with population aging.</p>

	<p>The research paper linked below finds that real house prices rise over time if the rate of household formation outstrips the rate of housing supply, but do not follow a speculative bubble path in the long run.</p>

	<p>The results explain why the upward trend in real house prices reflects market fundamentals and has continued despite population aging as the number of working and retired households grows relative to the number of older people seeking to sell.</p>

	<h3>Lack of new construction</h3>
	<p>Shortages of new construction means that demand outstrips supply.</p>

	<p>Between labor shortages, hiccups in the supply chain, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">NIMBYs</a>, zoning laws, and a surge in material costs, there isn&apos;t the supply of new homes being built to help meet demand. And the ones that do also have to raise prices due to the factors mentioned in the article.</p>

	<p>So if new construction prices go up, then the existing homes benchmarked against them will also charge more.</p>

	<h2>3. Economic prosperity</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 3/5</b></p>
	<p>A rise in general economic activity and increased prosperity puts more disposable income in consumers&apos; pockets and encourages homeownership.</p>

	<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img9.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

	<hr />

	<h2>4. Speculation and investments</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 4/5</b></p>
	<p>Speculative and risky behavior by home buyers and property investors is fueled by, what I consider, unrealistic and unsustainable home price appreciation estimates.</p>

	<p>In some markets, for example in the USA, you have additional factors like Zillow and other corporate buyers snapping up hundreds of houses.</p>

	<p>Or you may have seen people with jobs in high-cost-of-living (HCOL) cities become remote workers and choosing to relocate where they can buy a house.</p>

	<hr />

	<h2>5. People buying as a couple, instead of individually</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 3/5</b></p>

	<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find much data on this, however with an increased percentage of the population in the workforce, and with the ratio of median salary to median house prices being so high, it implies many people are using their joint salary to get a larger mortgage.</p>

	<p>Someone who is buying individually might have a salary of &pound;50k, so can get a mortgage of around &pound;200k.</p>

	<p>Whereas a couple with a combined salary of &pound;80k can get a mortgage (at the same salary multiplier) of &pound;320k.</p>

	<p>Due to the 4x leverage on salary, the couple can buy a much more expensive house.</p>

	<hr />

	<h2>6. Buy to let landlords</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 4/5</b></p>

	<p>The regulatory climate began to turn seriously against buy-to-let investors around four years ago, as regulators and politicians grew worried that, in the event of a property market downturn, highly leveraged landlords might be forced to sell off homes at short notice, substantially worsening any correction.</p>

	<p>So the government brought in a series of tax and regulatory measures designed to damp demand in the sector. The biggest change for landlords was the loss of a valuable tax relief on mortgage interest, phased out over four years from April 2017. For landlords with bigger mortgages, the change can determine whether a rental property is viable as a profitable business.</p>

	<h3>Airbnb's in the UK</h3>

	<p>Rooms available to book on Airbnb have rocketed in number in major UK cities.</p>

	<p>For example, nearly 80,000 rooms or homes in London are listed on Airbnb - more than any other UK city, according to figures from housing advocacy site Inside Airbnb analyzed by the BBC.</p>

	<p>The graph below shows this growth over time. Of course, many of these listings will be for a spare room in a house lived in by the landlord (the landlord gets a good tax rebate for this).&nbsp;</p>

	<p>However, many of these listings will also be taking properties off the market from people who want to buy a house.</p>

	<p>These properties are concentrated in a few people. For example, 1% of hosts control 17% of London&apos;s Airbnb market.</p>

	<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img13.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47910700">What the Airbnb surge means for UK cities</a></p>

	<p>On the positive side, there is some regulation against Airbnb, such as in London where:</p>

	<p>The Deregulation Act of 2015 introduced an exception that allows you to use residential premises for temporary sleeping accommodation without being considered a &ldquo;change of use&rdquo; if you use the property as a short-term rental for 90 or fewer nights in a calendar year, which is known as the &ldquo;90 night rule&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>If you use your property for short-term rentals for more than 90 days in a calendar year, the exception doesn&apos;t apply.</p>

	<p>We automatically limit entire home listings in Greater London to 90 nights a year, unless you have planning permission to host more frequently.</p>

	<h2>7. Banks lending more</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 5/5</b></p>

	<p>Although correlation does not equal causation, the chart below highlights the important relationship between how much people can borrow (loan-to-income ratios) and actual house prices.</p>

	<p>If the loan-to-income ratio were to fall in the face of rising mortgage rates, then that raises important questions about the future trajectory of house prices.</p>

	<h2>8. Government intervention</h2>
	<p><b>Impact: 4/5</b></p>

	<h3>Is the market too big to fail?</h3>
	<p>People are saying that the UK housing market is now too big to fail. The housing market is big and many people have bought on huge salary multiples (as they need to in order to get on the ladder).</p>

	<p>In addition, people are relying on housing as their primary source of wealth and retirement funding.</p>

	<p>I also hear phrases along the lines of:</p>

	<p>The government, no matter who is in power, cannot afford to let house prices go significantly down - let alone crash. The market should have collapsed in 2020 when millions could have lost their jobs - but furlough and mortgage payment freezes stopped that. And even as demand was simply waning, not falling off a cliff, they introduced the Stamp duty reduction to stimulate demand.</p>

	<p>COVID policies were prime examples of the levers the government will pull to prevent a market crash - and the same levers and more will be used in any other future scenario in order to prevent a housing market crash again. The UK housing market is too big to fail, and anyone in power no matter how they&apos;re politically affiliated will understand that.</p>

	<p>I can see this point of view, particularly when the government seems to continually create new incentives for people to buy houses with loans etc, causing house prices to increase even more.</p>


	<h3>Government policies</h3>

	<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/img15.JPG" class="responsive-img"></p>

	<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/329876-0">The practical difficulties in reviving the home-ownership dream</a></p>

	<p>The <b>stamp duty relief</b> available to first time buyers and the benefit enjoyed by those who have taken advantage of the <b>Help to Buy ISA</b>. The average tax saving for a first time buyer in England and Northern Ireland is just over &pound;2,600.</p>

	<p>While 94,000 house purchases were supported by a government top-up from an accredited savings plan, the average amount of that bonus was only just north of &pound;1,900.</p>

	<p><b>Help to Buy equity loan scheme</b> has more consistently bridged the deposit gap, providing assistance to an average of 40,000 first time buyers in England each year over the past five years.</p>

	<p>That scheme comes to an end shortly, leaving the government with a sizeable gap to fill, if it is to continue to arrest the decline in home ownership let alone send it back into growth territory.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, the decision to extend the <b>Right to Buy</b> to housing association tenants and the proposal to allow those on housing benefit to use it towards servicing a mortgage have been treated with widespread scepticism across the industry. Neither looks like they have the potential to move the dial in the way Help to Buy has done.</p>
